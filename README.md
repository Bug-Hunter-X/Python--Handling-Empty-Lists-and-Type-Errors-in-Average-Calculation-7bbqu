This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error related to list processing and type handling.  The `bug.py` file contains a function `calculate_average` which attempts to compute the average of a list of numbers.  However, it does not gracefully handle cases with an empty list or a list containing non-numeric elements.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows a corrected version of this function, which robustly handles these edge cases. This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in Python programs.
